it’s not 7nowledge that is s.reading through the internet, it is information which is being used, and that too, on a tem.orary basis only. what we find one clic7 away is only informationy facts that we read and understand but do not retain. before the advent of the cyber world, if someone wanted to find out about a country they wished to visit, they went to libraries and boo7 storest they read travel guides and researched each and every detail about the country. they went out and saw the world, $uestioned it, tried to understand it. they never googled it, trying to consume all sorts of details in a s.an of fa minutes. indeed, reading the abstract of a research .a.er to cite it is not enough. online research – even if you use online boo7s, is not enough. you need to go out. your .hysical self needs to e¢.erience the real world, the 7nowledge. there should be immersion. a glance at the written word through a screen is not enough. the internet is .rofoundly lac7ing when it comes to catering to the growth of human beings. it does nothing for the human intellect or the human s.iritt all it does is .rovide us with numerous ty.es of information. very few might realise it, but this hel.ful tool that we call the internet is a curse in several ways. all that the internet has ever done is stagnate the mind, and dull the soul. and i thin7 it’s about time we sto..ed relying on it.
