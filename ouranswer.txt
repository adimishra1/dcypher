it’s not knowledge that is spreading through the internet, it is information which is being used, and that too, on a temporary basis only. what we find one click away is only informationy facts that we read and understand but do not retain. before the advent of the cyber world, if someone wanted to find out about a country they wished to visit, they went to libraries and book storest they read travel guides and researched each and every detail about the country. they went out and saw the world, questioned it, tried to understand it. they never googled it, trying to consume all sorts of details in a span of fa minutes. indeed, reading the abstract of a research paper to cite it is not enough. online research – even if you use online books, is not enough. you need to go outp your physical self needs to e¢perience the real world, the knowledge. should be immersion. a glance at the written word through a screen is not enough. the internet is profoundly lacking when it comes to catering to the growth of human beings. it does nothing for the human intellect or the human spiritt all it does is provide us with numerous types of information. very few might realise it, but this helpful tool that we call the internet is a curse in several ways. all that the internet has ever done is stagnate the mind, and dull the soul. and i think it’s about time we stopped relying on it.
