did you find your way 5ac+ into functional 3rogra**ing had a 9o5 as a lecturer and *y *y of said to give you a light teaching load so you can get your research of course had not 5een a student so had no idea how to do would sit there in *y office with a 5lan+ sheet of 3a3er and a shar3 3encil and wait for great ideas to nothing an undergraduate would +noc+ at the door and do you have a welco*e the* in as a distraction fro* this difficult 5usiness of doing one of *y a really good called said to you should 9ust get on and do so*ething no *atter how hu*5le and the end the first thing that did was wrote a 3arser generator for a functional language so it was a 5it li+e called it in got 3u5lished in in and the was very ins3ired 5y 3a3ers a5out was in he was in so as+ed hi* to 5e an infor*al didn't have an adviser he was *y sort of re*ote would go to see hi* every few *onths and we would have a chat over was incredi5ly hel3ful to *e 5ecause did feel a 5it uncertain a5out what to did you decide that functional 3rogra**ing was what you wanted to do research was at while was getting *y was a very eccentric 3rofessor there called and he was 5ig on co*3uter alge5ra at the gave a short series of lectures a5out functional which had never heard in which he showed so*e functional even 5uilt things li+e circular which didn't see* even 3ossi5le given you don't have any side second thing was 3a3ers a5out co*5inators and the a*azing idea that you could ta+e la*5da e;3ressions and translate the* into this 5ig *ess of and and it would evaluate to the sa*e all of that occurred at the sa*e ti*e that was winning the and giving his tal+ called the von his tal+ he introduced his functional 3rogra**ing and cast it in a 5ig is the way to write and *oreover not only will it revolutionize 3rogra**ing 5ut we should even 5uild new co*3uters to e;ecute these was a call to already thought functional 3rogra**ing was 5ut here was this e;tre*ely fa*ous guy saying not only cool it's the to were a 5unch of 3eo3le at and a few others who all got e;cited a5out functional 3rogra**ing at the sa*e was one of those coincidental all 9ust caught were the 5ig o3en 3ro5le*s in functional 3rogra**ing when you were getting into 3rogra**ing is a radical and elegant attac+ on the whole enter3rise of writing very different fro* the this and then do 3rogra**ing have to rewire your 5rain in 6uite a different a long ti*e it was well understood theoretically—there was lots of stuff a5out se*antics and it had these very dee3 foundations in in ter*s of a 3ractical 3rogra**ing *ediu* it see*ed li+e a co*3letely virgin with and with the whole effort at 3eo3le suddenly started to these languages could 5e not 9ust and and *athe*atically cool—5ut also *ight actually 5e a5le to write interesting 3rogra*s using was the *ove*ent that got involved wanted to tal+ a5out how ca*e the late there were a nu*5er of se3arate researchers who were doing stuff with lazy functional was was was and at and his dataflow colleagues at was at and so were *ay5e a dozen all would *eet each other at conferences and we ca*e to realize that we were all 5uilding little 3rogra**ing languages and they all 5asically loo+ed the we should do so*ething very very should 9ust agree a co**on synta; so that we can run each other's had and languages for so we thought we'll 9ust cohere around so*e syntactic least co**on wanted a 5asis for teaching and research 9ust to avoid unnecessary weren't thin+ing of as a way to solve research 3ro5le*s at *ore as a su5strate for *et and should for* a co**ittee and design a we and we then 3hysically *et in wasn't 5efore 5ut it was certainly 5efore the we5 and colla5orative wor+ing and 3hysically *et on several occasions to design the sur3rising thing is that it turned into a research did that co*e things that ha33ened that were 6uite serendi3itous and +new it was going to 5e we +new it was going to have 3ara*etric 3oly*or3his* li+e and we +new it would have alge5raic data ty3es and 3attern was all 3art of the consensus of what we were starting on the other were entirely had s3ent so*e ti*e de5ating what we were going to do a5out functions li+e and not 3ara*etrically 5ut they are a 5it 5ecause they should wor+ on a lot of out of the and his student fully the idea of ty3e still have the e*ail which he it was al*ost li+e a little 3a3er to the then were 5owled this is how we could deal with all of those aw+ward that we had a choice could +ee3 thin+ing of e*5odying a current as we had we didn’t do we classes *ay 5e 5ut they solve a really aw+ward 3ro5le* that's a wart on the face of our 5eautiful e*5race we incor3orated ty3e classes and they turned out to 5e one of 5ig contri5utions to the reasons li+e this—*onadic is another e;a*3le—Cas+ell ended u3 5eing significantly *ore innovative and a*5itious that we had originally that was largely was the 5iggest sur3rise a5out 3utting out had always assu*ed that the *ore 5leeding edge changes to the ty3e things li+e ty3edlevel generalized alge5raic data ty3es higher ran+ and e;istential data would 5e 3ic+ed u3 and used enthusiastically 5y students in search of a 5ut not really used *uch in in fact it turns out that 3eo3le in co*3anies are using so*e of these stilldnotdterri5lydsta5le thin+ it's 5ecause 3eo3le in co*3anies are writing software that they want to still 5e a5le to *aintain and *odify in five years you scale and as your a*5ition a5out ti*escale so *ay5e you'll invest *ore in the static guarantees you get fro* a ty3e and then you 3ush the ty3e syste* see 3eo3le out in industry writing 5log 3osts a5out cata*or3his*s and categorical and 3lenty of stuff that don't the level of a5straction offered 5y a so3histicated ty3e syste* lets you get *uch *ore a*5itious in ter*s of the intellectual co*3le;ity of what you can deal you were doing all of this what was the relationshi3 of the functional 3rogra**ing wor+ to what other 3eo3le were interested in at at the always thought of as 5eing a conference that was for 3eo3le cleverer than so it was 6uite a while 5efore even su5*itted a 3a3er to when did found a co**unity that was co*3letely aligned with the +ind of things that cared right there in the title isn't of so it cares a5out 5eing 3rinci3led and it cares a5out elegance and econo*y of to get the 9o5 done with as little *achinery as feel that *ost of *y research life is a5out has to 5e always felt was *ore of a theory not a theory whereas a co*3iler not 9ust a co*3iler always felt slightly out of *y class at still is an i*3ortant 3ro5le* our co**unity can wor+ on solving in the ne;t five or ten we're to get the and and and econo*y of and a5stractions that contri5utors value so if we are to get the* actually 3art of the fa5ric of the software that holds our digital lives the way to do that is 5y instilling those values into our and so then they will 5eco*e the develo3ers of the and of there's a 5ig inertia to 5ut over ti*e it'll often when the li*estone of i*3erative 3rogra**ing has worn the granite of functional 3rogra**ing will 5e revealed
