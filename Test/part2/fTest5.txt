did $ou find $our wa$ 5ac+ into functional 3rogra**ing had a 9o5 as a lecturer and *$ *$ of said to give $ou a light teaching load so $ou can get $our research of course had not 5een a student so had no idea how to do would sit there in *$ office with a 5lan+ sheet of 3a3er and a shar3 3encil and wait for great ideas to nothing an undergraduate would +noc+ at the door and do $ou have a welco*e the* in as a distraction fro* this difficult 5usiness of doing one of *$ a reall$ good called said to $ou should 9ust get on and do so*ething no *atter how hu*5le and the end the first thing that did was wrote a 3arser generator for a functional language so it was a 5it li+e called it in got 3u5lished in in and the was ver$ ins3ired 5$ 3a3ers a5out was in he was in so as+ed hi* to 5e an infor*al didn't have an adviser he was *$ sort of re*ote would go to see hi* ever$ few *onths and we would have a chat over was incredi5l$ hel3ful to *e 5ecause did feel a 5it uncertain a5out what to did $ou decide that functional 3rogra**ing was what $ou wanted to do research was at while was getting *$ was a ver$ eccentric 3rofessor there called and he was 5ig on co*3uter alge5ra at the gave a short series of lectures a5out functional which had never heard in which he showed so*e functional even 5uilt things li+e circular which didn't see* even 3ossi5le given $ou don't have an$ side second thing was 3a3ers a5out co*5inators and the a*azing idea that $ou could ta+e la*5da e[3ressions and translate the* into this 5ig *ess of and and it would evaluate to the sa*e all of that occurred at the sa*e ti*e that was winning the and giving his tal+ called the von his tal+ he introduced his functional 3rogra**ing and cast it in a 5ig is the wa$ to write and *oreover not onl$ will it revolutionize 3rogra**ing 5ut we should even 5uild new co*3uters to e[ecute these was a call to alread$ thought functional 3rogra**ing was 5ut here was this e[tre*el$ fa*ous gu$ sa$ing not onl$ cool it's the to were a 5unch of 3eo3le at and a few others who all got e[cited a5out functional 3rogra**ing at the sa*e was one of those coincidental all 9ust caught were the 5ig o3en 3ro5le*s in functional 3rogra**ing when $ou were getting into 3rogra**ing is a radical and elegant attac+ on the whole enter3rise of writing ver$ different fro* the this and then do 3rogra**ing have to rewire $our 5rain in 6uite a different a long ti*e it was well understood theoreticall$—there was lots of stuff a5out se*antics and it had these ver$ dee3 foundations in in ter*s of a 3ractical 3rogra**ing *ediu* it see*ed li+e a co*3letel$ virgin with and with the whole effort at 3eo3le suddenl$ started to these languages could 5e not 9ust and and *athe*aticall$ cool—5ut also *ight actuall$ 5e a5le to write interesting 3rogra*s using was the *ove*ent that got involved wanted to tal+ a5out how ca*e the late there were a nu*5er of se3arate researchers who were doing stuff with laz$ functional was was was and at and his dataflow colleagues at was at and so were *a$5e a dozen all would *eet each other at conferences and we ca*e to realize that we were all 5uilding little 3rogra**ing languages and the$ all 5asicall$ loo+ed the we should do so*ething ver$ ver$ should 9ust agree a co**on s$nta[ so that we can run each other's had and languages for so we thought we'll 9ust cohere around so*e s$ntactic least co**on wanted a 5asis for teaching and research 9ust to avoid unnecessar$ weren't thin+ing of as a wa$ to solve research 3ro5le*s at *ore as a su5strate for *et and should for* a co**ittee and design a we and we then 3h$sicall$ *et in wasn't 5efore 5ut it was certainl$ 5efore the we5 and colla5orative wor+ing and 3h$sicall$ *et on several occasions to design the sur3rising thing is that it turned into a research did that co*e things that ha33ened that were 6uite serendi3itous and +new it was going to 5e we +new it was going to have 3ara*etric 3ol$*or3his* li+e and we +new it would have alge5raic data t$3es and 3attern was all 3art of the consensus of what we were starting on the other were entirel$ had s3ent so*e ti*e de5ating what we were going to do a5out functions li+e and not 3ara*etricall$ 5ut the$ are a 5it 5ecause the$ should wor+ on a lot of out of the and his student full$ the idea of t$3e still have the e*ail which he it was al*ost li+e a little 3a3er to the then were 5owled this is how we could deal with all of those aw+ward that we had a choice could +ee3 thin+ing of e*5od$ing a current as we had we didn’t do we classes *a$ 5e 5ut the$ solve a reall$ aw+ward 3ro5le* that's a wart on the face of our 5eautiful e*5race we incor3orated t$3e classes and the$ turned out to 5e one of 5ig contri5utions to the reasons li+e this—*onadic is another e[a*3le—Cas+ell
